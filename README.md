# What's New

## Abstract
This is a project I did during my time at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/).

I had 4 days to build the app. It is a dashboard interface that allows a user to filter news articles by type and search for a news article within the selected catagory.

The project focuses on building out simple React components and passing data down as props. 


## Setup
1. Clone/download this repo
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm start
4. Open localhost:3000 in your favorite browser (unless your terminal says otherwise)

## Project Next Steps
In future iterations, I'd like to style out the application more extensively, including animation and overall balancing of containers and cards.

I'd also like to create a more robust test suite where I mock out data and test functionality.
